Current spec guidelines:

    -Use bestcatholicwebsites.com as a reference for how the website should be laid out, as well as google analytics metrics

    -We need some kind of admin page to edit pages - and it needs to be very simple to use
        - Look into utilizing wordpress for this
    
    -Use client-side loading where possible
        -Site is hosted by att, and we get charged more for server-side loads

    -Look into making pictures easy to update. Folder location that can be added to/removed from?
        -Is it possible to make a page to edit graphics?
